I am a first-year [Master of Philosophy][] (MPhil) student in [Department of Applied
Mathematics][] , [The Hong Kong Polytechnic University][], under the
supervision of [Dr. Zhao Xingqiu][] (HKPU) and [Dr. Ye Zhisheng][] (NUS). 

I am visiting to ISE department in NUS as a research assistant this summer.

My research interest is applied statistics. I am working on research in Accelerated Life Testing. I would like to pursue Ph.D. in the
future.

I am widely interested in philosophy, computing science, social sciences
besides mathematics. <span style="color:white">Marxism,
</span>Neo-confucianism and Taoism have significant impact on me.

Currently, I am learning advanced math and statistics as well as
programming languages. I also decided to pick up badminton.
