This is a personal and self-guided article for softwares related scientific typesetting. It is not informative for everyone, perhaps, but I hope it is a worthy sharing.

# Typesetting System

## [WYSIWYG](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG)

Almost everyone (in China) in my age started to learn Microsoft Office Word as a document processor. WYSIWYG typesetting is just simple clicks. Of course, Word as well as other softwares in Officd is excellent. However, when I began to write scientific documents in university, it became a nightmare. Though Mathtype is good enough, it is hard to use sometimes and inefficient. Moreover, I becomed increasingly unstatisfied with typesetting provided by Word. I tried to learn so called "80% unkown functions". I found a (chinese) [book](http://book.douban.com/subject/1193565/) about automatic typesetting in word. The book introduces great solutions with VBA. Unfortunately, I was lazy at that time and though that I'd better spent time on learning LaTeX if I had to learn VBA. As a research student now, I spend little time on Word. I mainly writing something on other typesetting system.
 
## \\( \TeX \\)

\\( \TeX \\) is a well-known and popular document markup language. The creation  of it almost becomes a legend in computing science history. However, few people really use it directlly now. I know little about it.

## \\( \LaTeX \\)
\\( \LaTeX \\) is a typesetting system based on \\( \TeX \\). It is easier to use and widely use in academia.

The philosophy of \\( \LaTeX \\) is  

> authors should be able to focus on the content of what they are writing without being distracted by its visual presentation

So, the markups in LaTeX are mostly `\section`, `\table` and so on. Writers are forced to focus on logic structrue other than text styles.

Online Resources

* [LaTeX: an Introduction](http://www.techscribe.co.uk/ta/latex-introduction.pdf). One-page high-level overview of LaTeX
* [The Not So Short Introduction to LATEX 2Îµ](http://tobi.oetiker.ch/lshort/lshort.pdf). Famous introduction document. It is enough for beginners.

### Use in Windows
To use LaTex in Windows, users can choose distribution packages such as [TeXLive](http://www.tug.org/texlive/). For chinese, [CTeX](http://www.ctex.org/HomePage) is highly recommended.

### What you see is what you want

However, for people who are familar with Microsoft Office, the philosophy of those software may confuse them. Ultimately typesetting should be evaluated by its finaly visual apperaence. The markups languages can guarantee typesetting is tidy and beautiful but requires much time to learn. I am glad if 'What you see is what you want' (WYSIWYW) alternative is provided.

##LyX
I began to use LyX as suggestions in [Xie Yihui's blog](http://yihui.name). He highly recommended this sofware as a WYSIWYW tool for LaTeX. LaTeX guarantees quality of typesetting, on the other hand WYSIWYW makes mathematical writing straightforward and intuitive. Many short-cuts accelerate typing speed. Yet, Xie Yihui also warned one should not try LyX before knowing advanced knowledge in LaTex. But, anyway, it is WYSIWYW and free. What's more, GUI of LyX guides users to write math formulas without bothering to remerber all commands in LateX.

Online resources

* [LyX official page](http://www.lyx.org/) You can download LyX there.
* [Documentation](http://wiki.lyx.org/LyX/Documentation) Even though the users guides are embedded in LyX, you may want to download PDF files.
